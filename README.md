## Proof of Change


**DAO-governed Retroactive Funding with Verified Location Proofs for Environmental Impact**

### Overview

Proof of Change revolutionizes impact investments by creating a transparent, verifiable system that rewards proven environmental improvements through retroactive funding. Through our integration with Astral's Location Proof Protocol, we enable precise geographical verification of environmental projects using satellite imagery, while a DAO-governed retroactive funding mechanism ensures resources flow to proven impact.

### How It Works 

1. Project Submission

- Environmentalists and project creators submit proposals with initial satellite imagery
- Location proofs verified through Astral's protocol ensure geographic authenticity
- Smart contracts track project commitments and milestones


2. Verification Process

- Ongoing progress validated through location-tagged satellite imagery
- DAO members review and verify environmental improvements
- Transparent, on-chain record of project evolution


3. Retroactive Funding

- Successful projects receive funding based on verified impact
- Community-driven evaluation ensures effective resource allocation
- Incentivizes real, measurable environmental change

### Impact

- Brings accountability to environmental projects through satellite verification
- Creates a trustless system for funding ecological improvements
- Enables global participation in environmental initiatives
- Provides verifiable proof of positive environmental change
