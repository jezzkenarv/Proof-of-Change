## Proof of Change


**DAO-governed Retroactive Funding Using zkML for Integrity and MACI for Privacy**

### Overview

Proof of Change represents a significant leap forward in connecting blockchain technology with real-world impact. By solving critical issues of trust, verification, and governance, it opens up new possibilities for decentralized organizations to fund and verify projects that create tangible, positive change in the world. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize how we approach global challenges, from environmental conservation to urban development, by providing a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant funding mechanism.

### Core Concepts

1. Proposers submit project ideas along with current satellite imagery of the project area and its corresponding hash on IPFS.
2. The DAO reviews the proposals, examining both the images and their corresponding hashes to ensure they match the project descriptions and are valid.
3. DAO members vote on whether to accept the proposals based on this comprehensive review.
4. Upon completion, project proposers submit a final image of the project area and its corresponding hash on IPFS.
5. A trusted committee verifies the changes and votes on the completion using the MACI system 
6. The funds are released to the project proposers

#### Trustless Verification of Project Completion:
The primary purpose is to create a system that can verify real-world changes without relying solely on human testimony. By using satellite imagery as proof, it provides an objective, tamper-resistant method to confirm that promised work has been completed.
#### Incentivizing Positive Real-World Impact:
This system encourages projects that create visible, positive changes in the physical world. It could be particularly useful for environmental projects, land development, or infrastructure improvements.
#### Reducing Fraud in Decentralized Funding:
By requiring verifiable proof of completion, the system significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent funding claims. Projects can't simply claim they've done work without providing evidence.
#### Improving Decentralized Decision Making:
The DAO voting mechanism allows for community-driven decision making on which projects to fund, based on proposed changes and expected outcomes.
#### Protecting Against Collusion and Bribery:
The use of a MACI (Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) system for the final verification voting helps prevent committee members from being bribed or colluding to approve undeserving projects.
#### Increasing Transparency:
By using IPFS to store image hashes, the system creates a transparent, immutable record of project states before and after completion.
#### Enabling Retroactive Funding:
This model allows for funding to be provided after work is completed and verified, which can be more efficient and less risky than upfront funding.
